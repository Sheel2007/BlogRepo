# Python Introduction: Variables and Datatypes

![Computer](/images/Python%20Variables%20and%20Datatypes.jpg)

Python is a high level, dynamically typed programming language, which means that a programmer does not need to specify the data type of a variable when creating it. Instead, Python assigns the data type to the variable based on the value it is assigned.

A variable in Python is a named container that stores a value. Variables can store values of different data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and lists. To create a variable in Python, you simply need to assign a value to a name. For example:

```python
x = 10
y  = "hello world"
z = [1, 2, 3]
```
In the example above, `x` is an integer variable, `y` is a string variable, and `z` is a list variable.

Here are some of the most common data types in Python:

## Integers

Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. In Python, you can create an integer variable by assigning an integer value to a variable name, as shown above.

## Floating-point numbers

Floating-point numbers are numbers with a decimal point. In Python, you can create a floating-point variable by assigning a decimal value to a variable name. For example:
```python
x = 10.5
y = -2.5
```

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters and are used to represent text. In Python, you can crfeate a string variable by assigning a string value to a variable name. Strings are usually surrounded by string or double quotes. For example: 
```python
x = "hello world"
y = 'hello world'
```
## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items. In Python, you can create a list variable by assigning a list of values to a variable name. Lists are usually surrounded by square brackets. For example:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```
## Printing

The `print` function is one of the most basic and important functions in Python. It allows you to display and output on the screen, which is extremely helpful for debugging and understanding what's happening in your code. The `print` function takes one or more arguments and outputs the values of these arguments to the screen.

For example
```python
print("Hello World")
```

The code above will display the string "Hello World" on the screen.

You can also use the `print` function to display multiple values on teh same line, by seperating the values with commas. For example:
```python
x = 10
y = 20
print("The value of x is", x, "and the value of y is", y)
```
The code above will display the following output:
```console
The value of x is 10 and the value of y is 20
```

You can also format the output of the `print` function using string formatting. For example:
```python
name = "John"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old".)
```
The code above will output:
```console
My name is John and I am 30 years old
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, variables and data types are fundamental concepts in Python programming. Understanding the different data types and how to create variables in Python is the first step to becoming a proficient Python programmer. Keep practicing, and you'll be well on your way!
